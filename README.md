Coding Challenge: Build a Twitter app for iPhone

![](screenshot.png)

This challenge is part of the **iOS Boot Camp Exercise Program**. If you're not already part of the Exercise Program, sign up at [http://roadfiresoftware.com/ios-boot-camp/](http://roadfiresoftware.com/ios-boot-camp/) to learn more about the next one.

## How to get started (one-time setup)

1. Fork the [YATC-challenge](https://github.com/roadfire/YATC-challenge/) project on GitHub. (See [how to fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) if you don't know how.)
1. Clone your fork to your computer. (The [how to fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) doc helps with this, too.)
1. Create the Xcode project in your cloned directory.

## How to participate each week

1. Do the week's assignment, making commits along the way, and push your code to your GitHub repo. (This should be pretty familiar if you've used source control.)
1. When you're ready to submit the week's assignment, [create a Pull Request on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request). For the title of the Pull Request, use the form "Week X assignment" so I know what you're submitting. Creating the Pull Request tells me that you've finished the assignment and are ready for a review.
1. After I've reviewed your code, you may want to make changes and push them to GitHub. Pushing will automatically update the Pull Request, and I can review your code again.
